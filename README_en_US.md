## Installation:

Install through the marketplace or install through a compressed package.

## Usage:

After enabling the plugin, a dock button should be created. Clicking on it will open the main panel of the plugin.

### ConfigFile:

#### Theme Configuration

Theme configuration files and products can only be enabled under the corresponding theme name.

Configuring a product can only be enabled under the corresponding configuration file of the theme with the corresponding theme name.

##### Current Theme Configuration File:

If the theme you are using provides a configuration file, you can select it here.

Theme configuration files **cannot be added or deleted within the plugin**. If you need to make your own changes, you can refer to the configuration file writing guide below.

##### Current theme configuration product:

Don't ask me why it's called a product, I don't know either, I just casually wrote a name.

Configuration products are the generated CSS files.

Each configuration file can correspond to multiple configuration products.

#### Public Configuration

The public configuration file will take effect in all themes.

There can be multiple public configuration files. Currently, no editing function is provided, and files can only be uploaded (only within the secure context) or downloaded.

### Configuration Filtering

You can filter the display or effectiveness of configuration items based on keywords, configuration sources, groups, selectors, etc.

#### Actual Filtering

When actual filtering is not enabled, the configuration item filtering is just a visual display effect.

After actual filtering is enabled, only the displayed configuration items will take effect.

### Configuration Product Export

Theme configuration products and public configuration products can be downloaded separately.

You can click the `+` symbol on the interface to add a configuration product.

I am not very familiar with using GitHub, and I have other work to do as well. Please forgive me if I don't respond to issues in a timely manner.
